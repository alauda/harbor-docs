# Configure Job Log Storage

The Harbor Job Service supports storing job logs in multiple locations:

- **file**: Saves logs to local storage. If the Job Service runs on multiple nodes, a PVC must be mounted to provide shared storage.
- **database**: Saves logs to the database.
- **stdout**: Saves logs to pod stdout (not recommended for production use).

## Store Job Logs on Local Storage \{#store-job-log-to-local}

Add the following configuration to your Harbor instance:

```yaml
spec:
  helmValues:
    jobservice:
      jobLoggers:
        - file
    persistence:
      enabled: true
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        jobservice:
          jobLog:
            storageClass: <storage-class-name>
            accessMode: ReadWriteMany
            size: <storage-size>
```

## Store Job Logs in the Database \{#store-job-log-to-db}

Add the following configuration to your Harbor instance:

```yaml
spec:
  helmValues:
    jobservice:
      jobLoggers:
        - database
```
