# Modify Harbor Project Permissions Prompt Internal Server Error

## Problem Description

When modifying the permissions of a Harbor project, an `internal server error` is prompted.

## Root Cause

The Redis used by Harbor does not support the `keys` command

## Troubleshooting

Check the logs of the Harbor Core Deployment, confirm if the following error message is present:

```
2024-12-11T06:36:11Z [ERROR] [/lib/http/error.go:56]: {"errors":[{"code":"UNKNOWN","message":"unknown: NOPERM this user has no permissions to run the 'keys' command or its subcommand"}]}
2024-12-11T06:36:11Z [ERROR] [/lib/http/error.go:56]: {"errors":[{"code":"UNKNOWN","message":"unknown: NOPERM this user has no permissions to run the 'keys' command or its subcommand"}]}
2024-12-11T06:36:16Z [ERROR] [/lib/http/error.go:56]: {"errors":[{"code":"UNKNOWN","message":"unknown: NOPERM this user has no permissions to run the 'keys' command or its subcommand"}]}
2024-12-11T06:36:17Z [ERROR] [/lib/http/error.go:56]: {"errors":[{"code":"UNKNOWN","message":"unknown: NOPERM this user has no permissions to run the 'keys' command or its subcommand"}]}
```

## Solution

**Using Alauda Cache Service for Redis OSS**

In the namespace of the redis deployment, modify the `redisuser` configuration named `default`, remove the `-keys` configuration.

``` bash
[root@demo1-gm1 ~]# kubectl get redisuser
NAME                                   INSTANCE                  USERNAME   PHASE     AGE
rfr-acl-harbor-harbor-demo1-redis-default    harbor-harbor-demo1-redis   default    Success   44d
rfr-acl-harbor-harbor-demo1-redis-operator   harbor-harbor-demo1-redis   operator   Success   44d
```

``` bash
[root@demo1-gm1 ~]# kubectl edit redisuser default -n <namespace>

```

- before changed

``` yaml
# ...
spec:
  accountType: default
  aclRules: +@all -acl -flushall -flushdb -keys -* // remove the "-keys" configuration.
  arch: sentinel
  passwordSecrets:
  - harbor-demo1-redis-password
  redisName: harbor-harbor-demo1-redis
  username: default
status:
  phase: Success
  lastUpdateSuccess: "2024-12-11T08:40:17Z"
```


- after changed

``` yaml
# ...
spec:
  accountType: default
  aclRules: +@all -acl -flushall -flushdb -* // this line has changed
  arch: sentinel
  passwordSecrets:
  - harbor-demo1-redis-password
  redisName: harbor-harbor-demo1-redis
  username: default
status:
  phase: Success
  lastUpdateSuccess: "2024-12-11T08:40:17Z"
```

**Using Redis Self-Managed**

Redis instance Self-Managed please use the [Redis ACL](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl/) to check and modify command permission control.

## Notes

Due to the `keys` command scanning all indexes and causing the Redis service to block, consider whether to keep it enabled long-term.
