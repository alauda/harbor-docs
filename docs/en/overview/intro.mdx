# Introduction

## Harbor Introduction

Harbor is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access control, ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. As a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Graduated project, Harbor v2.14 delivers compliance, performance, and interoperability to help you consistently store, sign, and scan container images across cloud native environments.

Originally developed by VMware, Harbor has evolved into a comprehensive solution for enterprises seeking to manage container images securely in cloud-native environments. Harbor provides a centralized platform for storing, managing, and distributing OCI, Helm, and other container artifacts, making it an essential component in modern containerized application development and deployment pipelines.

## Harbor Advantages

The core advantages of Harbor v2.14 are as follows:

- Enhanced Proxy-cache

Syncs state with the upstream registry by deleting local cache when artifacts are removed; Serves the local manifest if its digest matches the upstream registry

- Single Active Replication

Adds an option to enforce single active replication, preventing parallel runs under the same policy.

- Enhanced artifact scanning

Adds support for fixVersion in CVE reports; Skips vulnerability checks for non-scannable artifacts.

- Enhanced garbage collection

Displays GC progress while running

- Enhanced CNAI Model integration

Adds support for raw CNAI model format.

## Scenarios

The main application scenarios of Harbor are as follows:

- Private Registry for Enterprise

  Organizations can deploy Harbor as a private registry to store proprietary container images on-premises, enforcing corporate security policies without exposing sensitive content to external services.

- Proxy Registry for Public Images

  Harbor can serve as a proxy cache for public registries like Docker Hub, reducing bandwidth usage and avoiding rate limits by pulling images once and caching them locally for multiple internal consumers.

- Air-Gapped Environments

  For high-security environments without internet access, Harbor provides a mechanism for manually updating vulnerability databases and managing both public and internal container images securely.

- Multi-Cloud Container Management

  Harbor's registry replication capabilities enable consistent container image management across multiple cloud environments, supporting hybrid and multi-cloud deployment strategies.

- DevSecOps Pipeline Integration

  With its scanning, signing, and access control features, Harbor integrates into CI/CD pipelines to enforce security policies throughout the development lifecycle.

## Limitations

- Resource Requirements

  Harbor requires significant resources for full functionality, especially when enabling features like vulnerability scanning and high availability.

- Storage Migration

  While Harbor supports multiple storage backends, migrating between them can be complex and requires careful planning.

- Performance at Scale

  For extremely large deployments with millions of artifacts, performance tuning may be required to maintain optimal operation.

- External Dependencies

  Some advanced features like vulnerability scanning require external components that need to be maintained separately.
