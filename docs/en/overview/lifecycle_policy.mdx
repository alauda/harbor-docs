# Lifecycle Policy

## Version Lifecycle Timeline

Below is the lifecycle timeline for released versions of the `Alauda Build of Harbor` operator:

| Version | Release Date | End of Support |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------- |

## Release Policy

A new version of the `Alauda Build of Harbor` operator is released every 4 months, updating the operator to the second-latest minor version released by Harbor (typically using the first patch version for stability). If the Harbor official team announces a minor version release schedule, we will also adjust our release timeline accordingly.

::: tip Differences Between Alauda and Harbor Versions
Alauda's Harbor operator versions are typically one minor version (4-6 months) behind the latest official Harbor release.
